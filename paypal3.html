				<h3>INTRO</h3>
				<p>Nowadays PayPal is payment platform for 244 million users all over the world, PayPal design team always wanted to provide intuitive experience to wide range of customers. Also, because I was a designer in a product team for financially underserved segnment, I was always interested in UX patterns for people who are not tech savvy.</p>

				<h4>Scalable design patterns</h4>
				<p>My responsibiliy was to work closely with our Consumer Experience Platform team and other product teams for design patterns and components that is scalable. From our definitions, a scalable design pattern should have enough flexibility so that design still can be used in different contexts.</p>

					<h4>Progress meter</h4>
					<p>For a PayPal Cash Card enrollment flow redesign project, I was looking for solutions to increase our conversion rate. A progress meter was one of the solutions worked well in user testing sessions. Since PayPal UI team was also exploring a progress meter pattern, we decided to be a trailblazer for progress meter and did related user testings. Initial design of the progress meter did not have a label for remaining steps and current step. But, user testing results were consistently told us that user always want to know more about where they are and how many steps they have.<br />After enrollment flow redesign along with progress meter, we increased the conversion rate from 56% to 66%.</p>

					<h4>Money Tiles</h4>
					<p>In early 2018, for better scalability, Consumer Experience Platform team initated web and mobile home page redesign and I was been involved as a design representative of our product team. During the design working sessions with other product teams and the platform team, we realized the amount of information on the home page could be overwhelming if a customer engages more with PayPal. Therefore, I worked with designers from other product teams to run user testing sessions and design jams to design a UX pattern that could work in different contexts.</p>

				<h3>INTRO</h3>
				<p>2016, it was the time PayPal design organization was focused to build design language to build cohesive user experience along with native mobile app redesign. Therefore, we built design system tool to acheive these goals.</p>

				<h3>What we acheived</h3>
				<p>By building Design Library, every design components are now synced to live stage and designers can see what componetns are available on live. Also, by updating design library, componetns on live stage get automatically updated to the new design.</p>
